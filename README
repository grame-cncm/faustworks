FaustWorks is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the
Faust dsp programming language.

This version is very experimental and undocumented. It requires
Faust to be installed as well as QT4. It relies on scripts to 
generate binaries for various audio targets. These scripts are located in scripts.lin, scripts.osx and scripts.win. Currently the only 
scripts provided are for linux and osx. If you add new scripts you should force FaustWorks to rescan the script folder using 'Restore Defaults' in the Preferences window.

FaustWorks is released under the GPL licence
